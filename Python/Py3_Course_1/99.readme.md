### **Introduction**
**Program:** Sequence of instructions that designate how to execute a computation.  
**Programming:** Taking a task and writing it down in a programming language that the computer can understand and execute.  


### **Assigning Values**

A certain number of variables may be assigned to the same number of variables. The `=` operator may be used to assign or bind values to variables. For Example: `x = 8` or `x,y =(8,9)`. The system overwrites any assigned values with the most recent statement. For Example: `x = 8` (first instance), `x = 9` (second instance), now x has been reassigned the value of 9.

**Print:** Displays or prints the value of a certain variable.

**Case Sensitivity:** Ensure to retain the same case type used when assigning while printing or displaying variable.

### **Numbers and Boolean Values**

**Integer:** Positive of negative whole number; without a decimal point. For Example: `x1 = 5`. In this scenario, x1 may be referred to as an integer. This may be confirmed using the `type(var)` function. The type function, `type (value)`, may also be applied to a value instead of a variable.

**Floating Points (floats):** Real number; with a decimal point. However `int( )` may be used to transform the variable into an integer. Furthermore, `float( )` transforms the variable into a float.

Not all variables should assume numerical values. An example of these type of values are **Boolean values**:  "True" or "False" values corresponding to 1s or 0s and On or Off. The True and False must be written with capital T and F.

### **Strings**
These are text values composed of a sequence of characters. 

Quotation marks are used to characterize values as strings. If there is a need to add strings to a return, the *+* operator is required. Two value types cannot be used at the same time, for Example: `y = 10, print (y + " Dollars")` will return an error. However `str( )` converts a number into text. 

Python can automatically discern the type of data being entered (integer, string, etc.) this does not need to be specified. The `\` is an escape character as it changes the interpretation of characters immediately after it. For Example: `'I\'m fine'` returns `"I'm fine"`. 

### **Python Syntax Fundamentals**

**Double Equality Sign:** The `==` means equals or equality of values. It returns a boolean value, True or False.

**Comments:** These are sentences not executed by the computer. They may be inserted by using a `#` symbol at the start of a sentence.

**Indexing Elements:** To obtain a character within a string, an indexing statement is used. For Example: `"Name_of_Variable" [index_of_element]`. In python, characters are counted from 0, not from 1.

**Code Structure and Indentation:** Statements belonging to a block of code or command can be indented using the Tab key, while separate statements or blocks of commands can begin from the far left.

### **Python Operators**

Arithmetic Operators | Description
---------------------|---------------
/                    | Division
`+`                  | Addition
%                    | Remainder
`-`                  | Subtraction
`*`                  | Multiplication
**                   | Raise to Power

The following may be referred to as comparison operators with exception to `\`.

Other Operators | Description
----------------|-------------------------
<               | Less Than
`> `            | Greater Than
==              | Equality of values
\               | Continue on new line
<=              | Less Than or Equal to
!=              | Non-Equality of Values
`>=`            | Greater Than or Equal to

Logical Operators may also be referred to as Boolean Operators.

Logical Operators | Description (written in lower case)
------------------|----------------------------------------------------------
AND               | Checks whether the two statements around it are True
OR                | Checks whether at least one of the two statements is True
NOT               | Leads to the opposite of the given statement

When combining logical operators, the **order of importance matters**. NOT is 1st, AND is 2nd and OR is 3rd.

Identity Operators | Description (written in lower case)
-------------------|---------------------------------------------------
IS                 | Functions similar to the Equality of Values
IS NOT             | Functions similar to the Non-Equality of Values

### **Conditional Statements**

**IF statement:** This requires an `if condition` : `conditional code`. For Example: `if 5 == 15/3` : `print ("Hooray!")`. For better clarity, after the colon, indent the conditional code on the next line. 

<img src="99.Note_Images/4.png" width="200">

**ELSE Statement:** This provides an alternative case, `else code` when the `if condition` does not satisfy the `conditional code`.

<img src="99.Note_Images/5.png" width="200">

**ELSE IF or ELIF Statement:** This provides an alternative cases and ends with an `else code`. It returns the assigned result based on the given `conditional code`. 

<img src="99.Note_Images/6.png" width="200">

As many `elif` statements can be added, however, the computer always reads the commands in sequence, from top to bottom. The sequence stops once the condition has been satisfied, thus the order in which commands are declared matters.

<img src="99.Note_Images/7.png" width="600">

The above sequence will return `Less` if the `y = 0` condition is placed after the `y < 5` condition.

### **Python Functions**
It is important to assign a more intuitive name to a function, a brief indication of what is does. For example, `plus_ten` or `addition_of_ten`.

#### **Key Parts of a Function** 

**Def:** Defines the function name and parameters.

**Print** May be used in the body of a function, but does not affect the calculation of the output. Given that only a single result can be returned from a function, print may be used to insert other elements.

**Return:** Returns a value from the function. This can only be used once in a function. This does not visualize the output, it specifies what a certain function is supposed to give back.

Another approach can be to use the `result` in building the body of the function and then returning the result.

OR

#### **Functions with Multiple Arguments** 

This is achieved by listing out all the parameters  and separating them with commas. Order matters in calling the function, else you need to specify the parameters. For example: calling `def subtract_bc(a,b,c)` as `subtract_bc(45,62,41)` or `subtract_bc(b=45,a=62,c=41)`.

#### **Built-In Functions in Python** 

Built-In Functions | Description
-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`pow(x,y)`         | Returns x to the power of y.
`round()`          | Specifies the number of decimal points.
`abs()`            | obtains the absolute value of an argument.
`type()`           | obtains the type of variable used as an argument.
`len()`            | returns the number of elements in an object or list.
`min()`            | returns the lowest value from a sequence of numbers.
`max()`            | returns the highest value from a sequence of numbers.
`sum()`            | calculates the sum of all the elements in a list designated as an argument.

The following transform their arguments into an integer,  float and string data type, respectively:

* `int()`
* `float()`
* `str()`

### **Lists**

This is a type of sequence of data points such as floats, integers or strings. The entire list can be accessed using the `Name_of_list` or a value in the list may be accessed by `Name_of_list [index_of_element]`. Remember to count from zero, for example:

Replacing elements in the list:

**del** may be used to remove an item from a list. Deleting an element changes the indices of all successive elements in the list.

**Methods in Python**

Built in methods can be applied directly. Methods may be implemented by calling the object, followed by the dot operator, and then stating the method. For example: `object.method("Element")`.

The `.append()` and `.extend()` methods may be used to add elements to a list.

The `.sort()` method may be used order objects and lists in alphabetical or numerical order. The revers

It is important to note that list elements are directly treated as string values. For Example:


**List Slicing**

This may be used to obtain a desired portion of data or elements from a main source. This can be done by calling the object, followed by square brackets, and then inserting the index of the first element, followed by the index of the element after the last desired element. For Example: The index of an element in a list: `Object_Name.index("Element")`

A list of lists can be obtained using the following approach:

**Tuples**

These is the default data sequence type in Python. They are immutable, cannot be changed or modified. The major different between tuples and lists is that, tuple elements are placed in parenthesis instead of square brackets.For example, a tuple assignment: `x = (50, 60, 70)` or `x = 50, 60, 70` or `a, b, c = 50, 60, 70`.

Functions can provide Tuples as return values:

### **Python Dictionaries**

Dictionaries represent another way of storing data. Each value is associated with a certain key. More precisely a key and its respective value form a key-value pair, `'k1':"cat"`. These use curly brace `{}`. 

Values may then be accessed by their keys as opposed to an index.

New values may be added to the dictionary using the following syntax: `dictionary_name [new_key_name] = new_value_name`. 

A similar approach may be used to replace the value of an existing key: `dictionary_name [existing_key_name] = new_value_name`.

Lists may be inserted into a dictionary:

See below, for another syntax used in creating dictionaries.

The **.get()** method can be used to obtain an object in a dictionary.
